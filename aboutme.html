        Hello, my name is Karla Ramirez, during my high school years, I’ve attended a lot of Computer science programs during the summer, such as Girls Who Code at Bank of America(2017), Google CSSI(2019). Those programs exposed me to different programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and javascript.
        Which guided me to pursue a career related to computer science. Currently, I’m in my second year of college attending CUNY New York City College majoring in emerging media concentrating in Game Design & Interactive Media.
        While I’m not too busy doing school work, I would draw, play video games, and work on side projects.
